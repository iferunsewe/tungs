1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
(Book)

2
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.740
No one...

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.000
I've found some new strange objects from Japan

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.460
You know this country is completely normal

5
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.900
If you use LSD.

6
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.580
And to celebrate it...

7
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.680
First of all, a toy to learn

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.980
how to eat fish

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.540
using chopsticks

10
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.720
I thought a game was supposed to be fun

11
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.560
this is the worst present ever

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.280
Merry Christmas! Here, a toy.

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.000
Can I switch families?

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.620
No.

15
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.840
When you say Japan you think of technology

16
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.240
with this little box

17
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.460
which works like an alarm

18
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.460
but shouts out a message of your choice

19
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.100
very useful to remember stuff

20
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.100
kind of like a post-it note only hundred times more expensive

21
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.339
I'm going to record a message that you guys send me everyday by email

22
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.260
so that it really sticks in my head

23
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.440
MAKE MORE VIDEOS!

24
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.839
Now if I just put that there...

25
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.460
(MAKE MORE VIDEOS)!

26
00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.179
Shut up.

27
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.640
Antoine Daniel I bequeath it to you

28
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.160
another object just not technological

29
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.460
that Japanese turned into one

30
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.140
A table tennis bat

31
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.880
Which makes the noise of a table tennis game

32
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.140
(MAKE MORE VIDEOS!)

33
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.200
What am I doing now?!

34
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.240
A little advice for you

35
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.740
If, on a rainy day, you see a guy like this

36
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.660
It might be that this guy has an umbrella

37
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.760
with this inside it

38
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.900
a girl's skirt.

39
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.620
You all know this, erm, what's it called...

40
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.440
Anyway people do what they want... but you just have to stay away from schools...

41
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280
Please don't call the police...

42
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.280
I'll hide in her knickers...

43
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.860
We cannot skip a musical moment with a noble, dignified instrument

44
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.540
Oh wait, no, it's a plush toy.

45
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.960
Unless...

46
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.220
No, I will not play this thing like an instrument

47
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.880
There needs to be at least some percussion, I don't know...

48
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720
In concert every night, at my place!

49
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.840
No doubt NO-ONE plays this instrument...

50
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.840
Option 1: A jewellery box

51
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.180
Option 2: A box of sweets

52
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.800
Option 3: A cat who wants to rob you.

53
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.680
It was option 3!

54
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.920
And you can even trick it...

55
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720
Ah got you! He's so stupid.

56
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.100
Now here's a thing that I would have dreamed to have had in high school

57
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140
because in classes I spent my time like this

58
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.179
(Life is hard)

59
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.900
But it was hard to constantly support your head like that

60
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.400
It creates tension in your arm

61
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.540
because school is hard and the Japanese have understood

62
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.940
The relaxation arm

63
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.920
Thank you, Japan

64
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.500
Like this I can do what I want with both my hands

65
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.799
Like for example...

66
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.780
Nothing.

67
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.500
High five

68
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.339
"A relaxation arm, so cute!" Stop the bullsh*t, ok!

69
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.540
There's more serious stuff in life!

70
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.620
Like when you want to look at your smartphone in bed but your arms hurt, there you go!

71
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.280
Let's focus on the important stuff, thank you!

72
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.579
Thanks to these arms designed for smartphones

73
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.980
which charge your phone as well, it's very clever

74
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.520
I can watch, in my bed, videos on human reproduction whilst having my hands free.

75
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.460
(This man is a as*hole, don't follow his example)

76
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.940
(Japanese beauty moment)

77
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.180
Last time I asked you not to take screenshots,

78
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.700
and you didn't obey at all.

79
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.100
This time I ask you, please don't spread my face around

80
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.100
I'm counting on you, I do this for you

81
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.579
It doesn't look very good on the box...

82
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.120
This 'Hannibal Lecter' mask is supposed to work out your face

83
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
thanks to three minutes of exercise per day

84
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.959
it say it on the box.

85
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.600
It firms up your face muscles

86
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.560
but they've forgotten a small secondary effect...

87
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.640
which is here

88
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.320
Before the face exercise mask

89
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.100
After the face exercise mask. (Buy it!)

90
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.240
No screenshots, ok! I'm counting on you

91
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.900
There's even a little battery. (It vibrates)

92
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.460
And you use it for three minutes a day

93
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.880
Ah, three minutes, like the Hannibal Lecter mask.

94
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.820
so you can combine them to get even more out of it!

95
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.500
Oh, sorry, I was just...

96
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.240
(MAKE MORE VIDEOS!)

97
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.700
Did you want something, or...?

98
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.580
No

99
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.300
This is my life

100
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.140
It's time to look at something a lot more entertaining

101
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.400
Robot fight

102
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.659
After the thumb robots, now we have remote controlled ones

103
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.220
It's great!

104
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.100
(Goodbye cruel world)

105
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.640
He fell over on his own

106
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.680
That was beautiful!

107
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.480
Stop! I'm gonna fall!

108
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.500
STOP!

109
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.520
Superhero pose

110
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.419
What does this do?

111
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.620
It's in Japanese, I'll take a photo

112
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.360
???The rotation of the wheel of explosion ???...

113
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.220
What ?!

114
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.500
There!

115
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.880
(He has just understood the meaning of life)

116
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.120
This is what the wheel is for, it puts the robot in fire mode

117
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.619
You see how high it gets in fire mode

118
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.880
(He sees a naked woman for the first time)

119
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.420
Winner takes all. Hold on...

120
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.840
Eh oh oh....respect...

121
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.200
Rather than doing impressive stuff this stuff is gracious....

122
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.840
High five ! one ,two ,three...

123
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.299
What's great about Japan, is that they are one step ahead of fashion

124
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.860
Here for example, what do you need to be stylish ? A cap...

125
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.960
Pff... it sucks...

126
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.280
Japanese have better: an inflatable samurai helmet!

127
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.960
Elegant, discreet... goes well with any type of outfit

128
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.919
Can save you from drowning!

129
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.740
Okay, I know what you guys are gonna say...

130
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.660
"Well, Cyprien you got a samurai helmet but no armor, it sucks!"

131
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.480
And I agree, you guys are totally right ...

132
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.920
Here look at this awesome samourai armor ...in  cardboard

133
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.140
Again I know what you're gonna say : "But Cyprien, if only you were a little more ... intimidating"

134
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.200
With a mask of a Dragon Ball Z character for example...

135
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.280
And I absolutely agree!

136
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.640
It smells like toilets...ok ...for Youtube

137
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.140
I think it's actually a beauty mask, for skin. Do I look like Freezer?

138
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.120
I'm Freezer's Romanian cousin.

139
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.360
Here I am, ready to fight the world, me samurai Freezer, with this thing...this arm..

140
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.360
(MAKE MORE VIDEOS !)

141
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.360
I...

142
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.600
Yeah... come back later... (This man is 27 years old)

143
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.680
Mom, if you happen to see this video, I still see my psychologist...don't worry...

144
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.560
I hope I'm extremely attractive, I have no doubts

145
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.740
It's a huge honour to have so many people follow me on Youtube

146
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.300
to do very serious things, as you can see.

147
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.980
You might know this already, but when you get 10 million subscribers,

148
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.720
Youtube sends you a diamond play button

149
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.840
even if I think it's made of metal but it looks like a diamond anyway

150
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.120
So maybe, thanks to you, I'll be the first French person to get this button

151
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.880
Who knows, it might be someone else, I don't know

152
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.599
But anyway, if it happens, it'll be amazing

153
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.000
It will happen. Thank you again.

154
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.340
I'll see you very soon in the next video.

155
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.000
Because I believe I have a very expensive post-it that'll remind me.

156
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.500
High five.

157
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.560
Thank you
